# Practical Microservices Workshop

More will come later, but for right now, this repo will verify that you can install and run what you need to for the workshop.

This workshop uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the code and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for running databases.

## Installation Instructions

1. Install Node.js
    * If you're on MacOS or *nix, I recommend [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
    * If you're on Windows, I've heard good things about [`nvm-windows`](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
2. [Install Docker for your platform](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/)

## Install Project Dependencies

From within the project folder, run `npm install`

## Verify Installation

1. Run databases 
  * `docker-compose rm -sf && docker-compose up`
2. Run verification script from this repo
  * `node script/verify-installation.js`
  * Your results should look something like:

```
$ node script/verify-installation.js

}
```

## Other Useful Software

* A database view, such as TablePlus (https://tableplus.com/).  It absolutely does not have to be this particular one, but you will benefit greatly from having something that will let you view the contents of the databases started in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
